*   **Clear:** Resets the text fields, clearing any entered data.
*   **Exit:** Closes the application.

## **Technology:**

*   **Java Swing:** Utilized for creating the GUI, leveraging components like `JLabel`, `JTextField`, `JButton`, `JTable`, and `JPanel`.
*   **ActionListener Interface:** Handles button click events, defining the actions to be performed when each button is pressed.
*   **actionPerformed() Method:**  This method is central to the system's functionality. It dictates the behavior of the application in response to button clicks. For example, when the "add" button is clicked, the `actionPerformed()` method is responsible for taking the data from the text fields and saving it as a new book record. It handles all button events like adding, viewing, editing, deleting, clearing, and exiting.
